- Run all tests vs run specific test files path
	npx playwright test POM/tests/Login.test.js file2

- Run files using filename (it could be partial 'Login')
	npx playwright test Login.test.js

- Run tests that are in line 22 in Login.test.js
	npx playwright test Login.test.js:22

- Run the test with the title (--grep 'alias -g' Only run tests matching this regular expression (default: ".*"))
	npx playwright test -g "Login user with correct email and password"

- Run tests with custom regular expression added (tags)
	npx playwright test -g "@hp"

- Only run tests not matching this regular expression. The opposite of --grep
	npx playwright test --grep-invert '@wip'

- Run by node npm command line test scripts
	"test-hp": "npx playwright test -g @hp"

- old config commands (npx playwright test -g '@hp' --headed --workers=1 --reporter=dot --retries=2 --timeout=20000)
	npx playwright test --headed           
	npx playwright test --workers=1
	npx playwright test --reporter=dot
	npx playwright test --retries=3
	npx playwright test --timeout=20000

- Stop after the first N test failures
	npx playwright test --max-failures=1 --workers=1

- Repeat tests number of N times 
	npx playwright test -g "Login user with correct email and password" --repeat-each=3
